## Fullstack Movie Database Exercise

### Overview

This is a hands-on coding session where you'll work on building features for **Mindera Cinema** - a simple movie discovery platform. You'll be enhancing an existing codebase by adding movie database functionality. The goal is to demonstrate your approach to fullstack development through practical implementation.

### Before You Begin

- Create a new branch for your work
- Feel free to install any npm dependencies you need
- Ask questions if anything is unclear
- Focus on getting working functionality rather than perfect polish
- There's no expectation to complete everything - work at your own pace

### Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript  
- **Data Layer**: JSON files (simulating a database)
- **GraphQL Layer**: Apollo Server (optional - you can bypass if preferred)

### Business Context

**Mindera Cinema** is a movie discovery app that helps users find and track movies they want to watch. The platform needs basic movie database functionality for users to browse, search, and manage their movie preferences.

### Stories

Choose which stories to work on based on your interests and strengths. There's no requirement to complete all of them.

**Story 1: Movie Catalog** *(Starting point)*
- Build an API to serve movie data
- Create a frontend to display movies
- Add basic search and filtering

**Story 2: Movie Management** *(If time allows)*
- Add functionality to rate movies and add to watchlist
- Mark movies as watched/unwatched
- Organize movies by genres or ratings

**Story 3: User Accounts** *(Advanced)*
- Implement user registration and login
- Personal watchlists for each user
- Simple state management for auth

### Getting Started

1. Review the existing movie data in `packages/api/movies.json` 
2. Start with [Story 1](./story1.md) to build the foundation
3. Progress through stories as time allows
4. Focus on demonstrating your development approach

### Notes

- The existing "Hello World" implementation can be replaced with your solution
- You can choose to use the GraphQL aggregator or call the API directly
- Working functionality is more important than perfect UI/UX
- Document any assumptions or trade-offs you make
- Include a brief README update explaining how to run your solution

### Tips

- Start with backend API design if that's your strength
- Or start with frontend if you prefer UI work
- Don't worry about authentication complexity - simple solutions are fine
- Focus on clean, readable code
- Ask for clarification on anything unclear
